title: panache
---

## Overview

**panache** is a CLI formatter and Language Server for Quarto (`.qmd`),
Pandoc, and Markdown files written in Rust. It's designed to understand
Quarto/Pandoc-specific syntax that other formatters like Prettier and mdformat
struggle with.

## Key Features

- **Full Pandoc syntax support**: Handles fenced divs, grid tables, definition
  lists, inline footnotes, and more
- **Math formatting**: Intelligent formatting for inline and display math
- **External formatter integration**: Hook into language-specific formatters (R,
  Python, Rust, etc.) for code blocks
- **Language Server Protocol**: Built-in LSP for editor integration with
  format-on-save
- **Fast and configurable**: Written in Rust with sensible defaults

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install panache from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install panache
```

Or download and install pre-built binaries from the [releases
page](https://github.com/jolars/panache/releases). Available for:

### Basic Usage

Format a document:

```bash
panache format document.qmd
```

## Why panache?

Existing formatters like Prettier and mdformat don't fully support Pandoc's
extended Markdown syntax used in Quarto and R Markdown documents. panache is
built specifically to handle:

- Fenced divs (`::: {.class}`)
- All table types (grid, pipe, simple, multiline)
- Inline footnotes (`^[text]`)
- Citations (`[@ref]`)
- Raw blocks and attributes
- And much more
