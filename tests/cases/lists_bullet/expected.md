A simple bullet list:

- First item
- Second item with a longer line that might need wrapping if it gets too long
- Third item

Another list with different marker:

- Item one
- Item two

- A function has a name, it takes a number of arguments (possibly zero), and
  when called it evaluates its body and returns a value.
- The function returns the value of the last expression in the body except when
  the body contains an explicit return statement.
- Formal arguments can be given default values when the function is implemented,
  and arguments can be passed to the function by position as well as by name.
- Functions should do a single well defined computation and be well tested.
