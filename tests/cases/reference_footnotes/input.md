# Reference Footnotes

Simple footnote[^1] in text.

Multiple footnotes[^2] in one[^3] paragraph.

With inline elements: **bold**[^bold] and `code`[^code].

Multi-line footnote[^multi] with complex content.

Here's one with multiple blocks[^longnote].

[^1]: This is a simple footnote.

[^2]: This is the second footnote.

[^3]: Third footnote here.

[^bold]: Footnote after bold text.

[^code]: Footnote after code span.

[^multi]: This is a multi-line footnote
    that continues on the next line.

    It can even have multiple paragraphs
    with proper indentation.

    - And lists
    - With multiple items

    All indented by 4 spaces.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.
