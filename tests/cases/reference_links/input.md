# Reference Links

Explicit reference: [link text][ref1] in paragraph.

Implicit reference: [GitHub][] is a platform.

Shortcut reference: [Wikipedia] works too.

Multiple refs in one line: [first][1] and [second][2] together.

Unresolved reference: [missing link][nonexistent] stays as-is.

Case insensitive: [CASE][myref] matches lowercase definition.

With emphasis: [*emphasized* text][ref1] and [text with `code`][ref1].

[ref1]: https://example.com "Example Site"
[github]: https://github.com
[Wikipedia]: https://wikipedia.org
